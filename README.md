# Collection of Bambu Studio profiles

## Profile organization

Bambu Studio knows 3 profile types:

1. [Filament](filament) profiles, which are for filament, as the name implies
2. [Printer](printer) profiles, these are for machines and nozzles
3. [Process](process) profiles, these are your quality/strength/print settings


## How to save a profile

Select the profile you want to save in the appropriate selector. Select stock profiles in the others.

Then, in the Bambu Studio menu, select `File -> Export -> Export presets..` and pick a folder.

## How to load a profile

Download the file from this GitHub or another source.

Then, in the Bambu Studio menu, select `File -> Import -> Import presets...` and pick the file.

## Submission guidelines

Please try to submit all profiles with a test print (preferrably a Benchy) with **default settings** other than the applied profile.

This file should be submitting alongside your `.json` profile as a `.jpg`, so, for example, if you submit `PolyLite ASA.json` as a profile, you should also submit `PolyLite ASA.jpg` with your test print.
